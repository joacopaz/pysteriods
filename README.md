# pysteriods
Simple pygame testing of an Asteroids game implementation for Python

To run it:
- If you are a pythonista and have `uv` installed (any true pythonista should 😏) simply run `uv run pyinstaller --windowed --noconsole main.py` to compile the binary

- You can download the executable/pre-compiled binary in the release section [here](https://github.com/joacopaz/pysteriods/releases/download/1.0/main)
